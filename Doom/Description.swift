var arachnotron = "Arachnotrons are built with genetic material recovered from the remains of the original Spider Mastermind, bio-engineered for cyber-augmentation. While its actual body exhibits only limited mobility, the oddly cerebral qualities of the Arachnotron make it a prime candidate for the impulse-controlled prosthetic frame that it now permanently inhabits. The UAC facility responsible for the Arachnotron's creation, intended to engineer and weaponize demons of its own design, was overrun after an outbreak occurred at its assembly plant, killing everyone inside. The facility, still operating under the directive of the administrative AI, continues to manufacture Arachnotrons autonomously."
var arch_Vile = "Forged from Hellfire, the Archvile is feared among lesser demons for its innate ability to channel and manipulate the unholy powers of Hell magic. Descended from the eldest race of demons, the Archvile has long held a place within the ruling caste of high-born demon lords. Possessing superior intellect among the demon ranks, the Archvile's psychomancy powers make it a natural- born ruler of the savage and primitive beasts of Hell, capable of bending weak-minded underlings to serve its will."
var doom_Hunter = "The Hell Priest Deag Ranak describes the Doom Hunter as a creature designed only to hunt the Doom Slayer. It maintains the reminiscent of Sabaoth, which was the third boss in the original Doom 3. This creature is a monstrosity, combining demons with technology. It rises from the ground while Deag Ranak narrates over its intimidating reveal. One arm is a chainsaw, the other is a rocket launcher. It has no legs, as the bottom half of its body contains jets that help it fly around the map. Right next to the jet are sentry guns, aimed directly for the Doom Slayer. While its first encounter is in a 1v1 fight (outside of some smaller minions attacking the Doom Slayer at the same time), later fights pit the Doom Slayer against multiple Doom Hunters at a time. It also uses an energy shield to protect the higher part of its body when it receives too much damage. It is prepared for whatever the Doom Slayer decides to throw at it and was carefully produced by the Hell Priests to take him down. This guide will provide tips and tricks for slaying the Doom Hunter."
var icon_of_sin = "The Icon's presence warps reality, damaging the intricate order of our dimension merely by existing within it. If the Icon is allowed to remain unchecked it would lead to the total devastation of Earth, followed by a breakdown of spacetime around the planet. The resulting black hole will eventually drag our entire universe down, casting it into the mouth of Hell as a conquest to be absorbed by the Dark Realm. The Khan Maykr had taken measures to augment the titan, installing Maykr technology throughout its structure to ensure it could be controlled. With the ritual interrupted the Icon is now fully unleashed, raging across Earth until Hell consumes all. No longer bound by the Heart of the Betrayer's Son, the Icon of Sin is free from any measure of control that the Maykrs might have conceived. Only the Slayer, prophecied in Argenta legend to stand against the Icon, can stop this apocalypse. As it is written in the prophecies of ancient Sentinel scripture, the Titans - towering elder demons of the infernal age - would return, unearthed from their immortal slumber. The Titans are believed to be harbingers of the end-times, primordial forces of chaos and destruction.Born from the tortured spirit of the Betrayer's son, it was by Hell's unholy design that the Icon of Sin was given flesh. The fearsome Titan, forged from the essence of mortal suffering, once bore a human soul - a soul now transmogrified and entombed within the still beating heart of its former self. The Betrayer, seeking to free his son from eternal torment within the depths of Hell, made an agreement - a pact sealed by the black fates of darkness - that promised to grant his son the chance to return from death. The son would live again, but not as a human - in Hell's endless cruelty, the son was damned to become the Icon, an inhuman existence bound only to its former humanity by the now disembodied, undying mortal heart"
var pain_elemental = "An abhorrent creation of the Umbral Plains, the Pain Elemental is descended from the primal, abominable depths of the demon world. Knowing only its own torment, the Elemental is cursed to forge Lost Souls within the fiery pit of its gut--a process that is excruciating and without end for the duration of the creature's miserable lifespan. The Elemental's only reprieve from its own agonizing and torturous existence is the projection of suffering into the world. For this reason, the Pain Elemental reaps great satisfaction from indiscriminate killing and the infliction of misery upon those weaker than itself."
var tyrant = "Demon Lords to the black soul pits of Babel, the Tyrants have long served as wardens and slavers of the infernal pits. Weaponized and cybernetically altered by the UAC, the Tyrants are tasked with overseeing the collection and extraction of sin-branded souls from the mortal world, their role in Hell ordained by the unholy sigil of the Elder Hell-gods. A sadistic master of lesser demons, the Tyrants are feared for their cruelty and malice."
var whiplash = "The Whiplash is a Cybernetic Snake like Enhanced Demon, with two thin horns curving up and backwards over its head, where its brain is exposed. Its arms are covered in what resembles long, black gloves and wields a chain whip ending in a curved blade, hence its name. From its abdomen down, the Whiplash's body is cybernetic and snakelike. According to game director Hugo Martin, the Whiplash is female."
var betrayer = "Valen was one of the Night Sentinels commanders who led countless battles against the forces of Hell. However, after his son perished in battle, he was driven mad and relentlessly haunted by demonic visions of his son living in an tortured existence. Valen soon fell into desperation to bring his son back to life at the cost of betraying his kin. Valen made a deal with the Hell Priest, Deag Grav, to resurrect his son in exchange for leading him access to the Wraiths. He gave Grav the keys to the Sepulcher of Elements and opening the vault of the sleeping Wraiths. The ancient creatures were abducted to Hell and Grav siphoned the Wraiths' power to empower Hell's demonic legions and overwhelm Argent D'Nur, dooming the kingdom to which Valen swore a lifelong oath to protect. Valen's Night Sentinels participated in a failed and final offensive in the heart of Hell in which the Order were left scattered across the Unholy Realm and fought to the last man. The treacherous Night Sentinel never did gain back his son; instead, Deag Grav resurrected his son in the form of the Icon of Sin. Extremely guilt-ridden by what he had done, Valen chose exile in Hell. Since then, Valen is condemned by his people as the Betrayer."
var carcass = "The product of inhumane bio-mechanical engineering, the Carcass was created in the remote labs of the Cultist enclave. Neither truly living nor dead, it exists in a state of partial re-animation - its cybernetic armature simulating a living impulse within a decaying organic host. Devised as a means of extending a soldier's usefulness in combat after death, the unliving host can only be destroyed by severing the body from its cybernetic implants."
var cacodemon = "Hunters of the Sloughlands, the Cacodemon lurks the bottomless and murky depths of Hell in search of easy prey. An aimless wanderer, the Cacodemon is mostly devoid of cognitive ability, sensory awareness, and otherwise commonly occurring impulses. Driven only by a singular desire to feed, the Cacodemon is likely to appear wherever there is flesh to be consumed, bringing with it an insatiable propensity for hunger. It is said that the Cacodemon bears some resemblance to the cycloptic titans of ancient Hell lore, leading Sentinel scholars to believe that the forgotten titans may yet live on in some disembodied form."
var cyber_mancubus = "Mechanized and heavily augmented, the Cyber Mancubus is equipped for frontline warfare. Equipped with dual-barrel arm-mounted mortar cannons, the Mancubus's integrated weapon system utilized the body's naturally occurring biotoxins, refining this corrosive, viscous membrane into toxo-plasmid ammunition feed. Siphoned from the spinal gland and funneled intravenously to the weapon conversion system, the corrosive secretion is discharged by an alternating firing mechanism, which dispenses the toxo-plasmid as either heated projectile or ignited fluid, the latter resulting in a flamethrower-like incendiary spray capable of burning through armored plating."
var deag_grav = "Originally a priest of the Order Deag, Grav was present along with Ranak when the Night Sentinels brought in a stranger they had found in the grounds of Sentinel Prime. As was customary for the Argenta, the man was sent to the Arena to battle against others, proving more resilient and relentless despite his maddened ravings about demons. Grav praised the stranger's capabilities before the Khan Maykr ordered him to dress his wounds and bring him to her so he could tell them more about the others he mentioned. Along with his fellow priests, Grav was eventually corrupted by his lust for power and Argent Energy, becoming a demonic entity who only sought to ensure the prosperity of the Maykrs at the expense of the worlds under their command. He created a scheme to ensure total victory over the realm of Argent D'Nur by making a deal with a member of the Night Sentinels: Grav would resurrect his fallen son if he gave Grav access to the Wraiths in the Sepulcher of Elements. Once the treacherous Sentinel did his job, the Hell Priest and his cabal siphoned the Wraiths' own essence to the Well that gave Hell the advantage in the war and finally absorbed the dimension of the Night Sentinels. While Grav fulfilled his promise after a fashion, he instead used the heart of the Betrayer's son to resurrect him in the form of the Icon of Sin. Thereafter, Grav became the overseer of Sentinel Prime, turning the Arena into a bloodsport that pit humans against demons to entertain himself and the populace that remained loyal to the Khan Maykr."
var deag_nilox = "Deag Nilox once served as a holy Sentinel Priest in Argent D'Nur and had been the first to discover and manipulate the gateways to Hell. However, he became corrupted by Hell's influence and the taste of Argent Energy and now follows the orders of the Khan Maykr."
var deag_ranak = "Deag Ranak was once a high-ranking member of the Order Deag, a priestly caste of sorcerers who stood below the great Khan Makyr in the ancient society of Argent D'Nur. He appears to have been one of the priests who investigated the Elixir, Argent Energy, following the incursion of Hell's forces on his homeworld. Though he seems to have once been an honourable man, consumption of the Elixir tainted and corrupted him just like the other members of the Order Deag. Along with the other two High Priests of the Deag, he served as leader to the forces loyal to the Khan Makyr during the Argenta civil war, and was instrumental in the betrayal of the Night Sentinels, arranging a false mission that left Argent D'Nur's mighty protectors scattered across the shores of Hell, with only the Doom Slayer surviving. Ranak appears to have been the Priest most directly responsible for the invasion of Earth, having prepared a Hellgate for the demonic incursion and also briefly coordinating with Olivia Pierce on Mars to set off the initial events. He is not the most powerful of the Hell Priests, but certainly seems the most influential, and is described by the title Viceroy to the Chaos Throne."
var dread_knight = "A variation of the Hell Knight breed, the Dread Knight has been modified and hardwired for aggression. Armed with exo-prosthesis powering energy-blade augments, the Dread Knight is the lethal result of UAC Cultist engineering. Epinephrine regulators modulate the Dread Knight with an unbroken flow of rage-addled adrenaline, while its endorphin receptors have been synchronized to respond with the use of its arm-mounted blades. With each kill, the Dead Knight is injected with a flood of artificial dopamine. As a result of its augmentation, the Dread Knight is driven by a biochemically engineered state of pure, unbroken rage - suffering for which respite can only be found in the act of the kill."
var gargoyle = "Like their Imp brethren, the Gargoyle is an agile, relentless pack hunter. Native to the Sentinel world, this beast has plagued the Sentinel Guard for centuries. As one of the few demon breeds that could bypass the walled defenses of Sentinel Prime, the Gargoyle could appear without warning and claim hapless townspeople before disappearing into the wasteland. Only the most skilled marksman of the Night Sentinels could intercept this aerial threat, a peril which demanded an ever-vigilant watch over the city's perimeter."
var gladiator = "The Gladiator has a large body similar to the sketch of the classic Hell Knight by Adrian Carmack but with the addition of some body armor. However its head resembles a classic Hell Knight but missing one of its eyes, it wields a shield and mace for weapons. In The Art of Doom Eternal, it is stated that the Gladiator cannot die, as when his flesh is destroyed, his soul shall wait for his body to rebuild like most demons in folklore, mythology, and in collective religions. There is a way to kill him, however, that involves destroying his shield, which is stated to contain the tormented soul of its master."
var hell_knight = "The Hell Knight, warrior beast among demons, has earned its place over the millennia in service of the eternal Archdemons. As imposed by the sovereign houses, Hell Knights have long served as barbaric enforcers of the Netherworld, impelling lesser demons by way of brutality. Rare among demon-kind for its innate regard from primal orders of hierarchy, the Hell Knight exhibits adherence to the prevailing rule of its demonlord masters. Requiring little compulsion on behalf of its highborne masters, Hell Knights readily serve the Elder Hell-gods for the extent of their lifespans, reaping great satisfaction in the way of war and desecration."
var imp = "Scavengers of the underworld, Imps are among the most common of beasts found on the scorched surface of the Hellscape. Lesser demons of Hell, the Imp possesses limited intelligence, driven only by a hunter's impulse to seek out prey - a task for which the Imp is naturally suited due to its innate capacity for violence. As a result of these attributes, the Imp makes for an ideal footsoldier and is oft deployed in the warring legions of Hell, easily manipulated and controlled by commanding highborne demons at the behest of the sovereign chapters. It is common for the Imp to appear at the frontline of an offensive attack, an expendable resource unleashed in great numbers to overcome and break through the enemy front."
var khan_maykr = "The Khan Maykr is one of the many Khan Maykrs that is birthed by the Singularity, the collective Maykr consciousness, that is destiny-bound to lead the Maykr race until the next Khan is born. The Singularity, which contains the conscious soul-data of every major Maykr that has ever lived and died, processes and refines this data as a means of selective evolution. As hierarch of the conscious neural-matrix to which each Maykr is interconnected like a hivemind, it is physically impossible for a Maykr to refuse the collective order of shared consciousness and disobey a Khan. This system has functioned without error since the creation of Urdak, until the disappearance of the Father, the progenitor of the Maykr race, caused by a rogue Maykr known as the Seraphim. Without the Father, the Maykrs are incapable of creating a successor to the Khan lineage, allowing the current Khan Maykr to rule Urdak without limit. The Khan Maykr led her race in expanding their influence and dominion across the known universe. Among the races they converted to serve their cause are the Argenta of Argent D'Nur. During the time of the reign of King Novik, an outsider known later as the Doom Slayer came to Argent D'Nur and was judged in the Coliseum. The Khan Maykr was piqued by the Slayer and his ravings about demons in which she had him brought before her and ordering her minions to learn his language, as she wanted to know more about the lands, creatures and a dark place unknown to the Queen and her caste. The coming of the Slayer soon led to the Maykrs' contact with the demonic legions of Hell, as they invaded Argent D'Nur and causing the outbreak of the Unholy Wars. The Khan Maykr was interested of the demons' Hell Essence and gave her blessings to the Order of the Deag to study the Essence. Eventually, their research discovered that the demonic energy has an unlimited potential to revolutionize military science and industrial healing, which include the prevention of Transfiguration that the Maykrs feared.The Khan Maykr then commanded the Argenta to take the lands of Hell and harvest the Essence, as she has the Order of the Deag to construct vast factories on the Hellscape to gather Essence for further development that would combined the Wraiths' energy and Hell Essence into Argent Energy. The Khan Maykr was unease with the unforeseen rise of the Doom Slayer, who was blessed with greater powers by the Divinity Machine due to the actions of Samur Maykr in which the Khan Maykr did not gave his permission. But the Khan Maykr saw an opportunity to find profit in the Slayer's endorsement among the indoctrinated masses and using him to pave the way for more Essence. As the war against Hell wages on, the Khan Maykr later founded a suitable way of gaining more Essence; the Khan Maykr made a secret pact with the Dark Lord of Hell: to harvest the flow of Argent Energy from Hell to Urdak, in return for granting demon-kind access to all worlds under her influence. The Khan Maykr justified the sacrifices of countless mortal souls as the only way to prolong the survival of her race. She and her converts helped the demons with the processing of mortal races into Argent Energy, using slave labor to construct the Soul Spires in Nekravol to accelerate the efficiency of Argent production as captives are tortured until no semblance of humanity remains within them, thus extracting the soul and leaving the victim's body to transform into demons. The Khan Maykr's insidious conspiracy is eventually discovered by the Night Sentinels and lead to a civil war on Argent D'Nur between those who remained indoctrinated and loyal to the Maykrs and the other opposed to the Maykrs. The war ended with the opposition crushed by betrayal among the Night Sentinels' ranks as the Khan Maykr's enemies are left scattered in Hell where they fell against Hell's endless demonic horde. However, the only survivor of the Night Sentinels is the Doom Slayer, who remained surprisingly relentless and undefeatable against Hell."
var king_novick = "During Novik's reign a stranger not of Argent D'Nur known as the Outlander was founded on Sentinel Prime and was taken to be judge in the Coliseum. This stranger's determination in the Blood Arena won the admiration of the Sentinel people. Sometime after the arrival of the Outlander, Argent D'Nur was invaded by legions of demons from Hell. King Novik led his people against the demonic invaders and was given the blessings of the Khan Maykr to allow the Order of Deag to research the demons' powers that gave way to the discovery of Argent Energy. Novik soon caught notice of the Outlander's familiarity with their enemies and his utter brutality towards them. He immediately deemed the Outlander worthy of selection as a member of the Night Sentinels while silencing the Inquisitors of the Sentinel Guard for suspecting the Outlander of colluding with the demons. The Outlander proved himself to be one of the Argenta's mightiest warriors and has since become known as the Doom Slayer."
var lost_soul = "The Lost Soul has its origin among the Damned former humans who have fallen from the mortal world, doomed to an unliving eternity as sin-branded slaves of Hell. The Damned are seemingly endless in number, their populations growing by the thousands with each rise of the black sun. For many, the torturous existence of crushing slave labor is all that awaits. The bodies of the Damned are brittle, and those who become broken in labor - their bodies ruined, dismembered, or otherwise incapable of servitude - are transported to the pits where their souls must be extracted for further use. Those fortunate enough to escape this process are what inevitably become Lost Souls; their spirits transmogrified into physical form. The Lost Soul knows only madness, its memory a haunted image of its former mortal life. These creatures live a fleeting existence, roaming mindlessly, seeking only that which grants them a final death."
var mancubus = "The Mancubus, hulking behemoth of the demon world, bears notable differences from those of its kind first encountered by the UAC expedition team on Mars. Unlike its brethren which wore a naturally occurring armored carapace, this variation shows clear signs of pre-existing man-made modifications. Armor-plating augmentation to its exterior and a sophisticated arm- mounted weapon system indicate a clear intent to upgrade and weaponize the fighting capacity of the Mancubus, whose heavy stature and resilience make it a formidable threat in battle."
var marauder = "As civil war consumed Argent D'Nur, the Night Sentinels Guard was quartered by their faith. Torn between serving the Khan Maykr or revolting against that which they swore to protect. Those most disillusioned forswore their oath to the Sentinel royalty, abandoning their pact of allegiance made to the throne. These hardened warriors joined the separatist group led by the exalted Priest class, allying themselves with the Maykrs and their devout acolytes in an attempted coup against the Sentinel royal house. Those Sentinel warriors who fell in battle, having sided with the Maykrs, were ultimately denied finality in death. Resurrected by the Divinity Machine of Maykr design, these fallen Sentinels were returned from the dead, transformed by Hell's power, and recreated with a singular purpose: to hunt the Slayer, now reborn as Knights in Hell's army."
var mech_zombie = "The mecha zombie is a new fodder-class enemy introduced in Doom Eternal. Its appearance suggests heavy cybernetic modifications, notably on the right arm, which has been replaced with a combined energy gun and flamethrower from the elbow down. The mecha zombie's arms are unusually proportioned, with short biceps and longer forearms along with a metal claw on its left arm. Its skull is completely bare with glowing red eyes and its intestines are exposed."
var pinky = "As Hell emerged on Earth the Pinky began to appear on terrestrial soil in great number, rapidly becoming the bane of existence to ARC military fortifications. Utilizing its armored frontal carapace, the Pinky is able to penetrate defensive encampments, breaking through walled defenses and using its ramming ability to upturn and immobilize armored vehicles. ARC deployments, dependent on their ability to hold the line against encroaching forces of Hell, could be disrupted and even overtaken by a single Pinky, were it able to penetrate and break through their defensive matrix. allowing a greater demon influx to pour in after it. The ARC rapidly prioritized the target status of the Pinky, issuing high-range bombardment to prevent the Pinky from gaining proximity."
var prowler = "A creature of darkness, the Prowler hunts from the shadows, preferring stealth and concealment to open conflict. Imbued with parietal infravision, the Prowler is able to see that which is unseen to the naked eye. Known among the Sentinels as 'the Nightstalker', the Prowler's preternatural sense of sight makes it a lethal hunter, capable of tracking its prey even in the pitchest black of dark. Believed to be peripherally descendant to the lesser Imp brooding, the Prowler is rarely seen in groups, forsaking pack-hunting for the precision of the solitary pursuit."
var revenant = "The Revenant program, a bio-weapon experiment utilizing re-animated necrotic human tissue, was believed to have been destroyed with the collapse of the UAC facility on Mars. However, the emergence of the Cultist enclaves on Earth - former UAC deviations now under Hell's direct control - have begun work on a second wave of production of the Revenant program. While much of the platform's existing weapon payload is preserved as originally designed, the cyber- neural programming has undergone modification. Patterned signals are wired to the host's frontal cortex, which in turn stimulate a state of frenzied, unrestrained bloodlust. While these signals are active, the host is incapable of thinking or feeling anything but a singular compulsion to inflict death and violence on the living."
var samuel_hayden = "Samuel Hayden was born to the powerful Hayden family and was a very prodigious intellectual and philanthropist. He is accomplished in several scientific fields, including thermodynamics, electromagnetic theory, and nuclear sciences. He was the founder of the Samuel Hayden Foundation, which promoted the sponsoring of young scientific talent and funding scientific programs in schools and colleges. After Hayden was appointed as General Director of the Global Science Council, the UAC recruited him. Soon after Argent Energy was discovered on Mars, Hayden subsequently took over the leadership of the UAC and began the construction of the Argent Tower on Mars. During construction of the Argent Tower, Hayden was diagnosed with a stage 4 incurable brain cancer and left with a few months to live. Hayden avoided his death by transferring parts of his brain into a 3-meter tall mechanoid body, allowing him to be virtually immortal. It was implied that Hayden chose this form for his expeditions into Hell. After his rebirth, Hayden was appointed as Project Director of the Argent Facility and under his leadership humanity embraced an Argent-based technological revolution as Argent Energy is integrated into all forms of technology. By the time the Argent Tower finished construction in 2127, Hayden personally dispatched the first Argent package to Earth."
var seraphim = "According to the Ligria Sultagenta, Samur was chancellor to the Khan Maykr. During Argent D'Nur's war against Hell, Samur played a role in helping the Doom Slayer and his allies in stopping a major demonic assault led by a monstrous Titan known as the Dreadnought. After witnessing the Doom Slayer's prowess in battle, and acting on his own accord, Samur hurried the Slayer to the Chapel of Purity and submitted him to the Divinity Machine; granting the Slayer enhanced strength, endurance and agility. This allowed the Slayer to single-handedly defeat the Dreadnought. As Samur acted without the Khan Maykr's consent, his actions was seen as heretical and he was believed to have been exiled from Urdak afterwards. Prior to his disappearance, Samur stole the essence of The Father from Urdak, which damaged the Maykrs' Transfiguration process of voluntary death and resurrection, and prompted the Khan Maykr to siphon Argent Energy from Hell in order to sustain her race. The reasons for why he stole The Father's consciousness and what he did with it remains unknown."
var soldier = "Once frontline infantry fighting to protect Earth from the demon invasion, the Hell Soldiers have been claimed by darkness, turning them against their fellow soldiers in the midst of battle."
var spectre = "Born from an ancient screed of forbidden psychomancy, it was by the tomeic inscriptions of the occultic Six Sealed Eyes that the Spectre was made manifest. Divined in desecrated ruins untouched by light for an eternity, warlocks of an abandoned sovereign house unearthed the verboten scripture, seeking rebellion by means of black magick against the rule of the infernal Archdemons. By way of sorcery were numerous abominations and ungodly forms brought forth into the Hellscape - among them, the Spectre; an ethereal amalgam of the Pinky. For their role in these miscreations, the Archdemons would enact as retribution against its insurgents an unspeakable punishment, a decree of suffering that would be without end."
var zombie = "Possessed by the influence of Hell, once human underlings that follow in Hell's ranks are those that have been corrupted and deceived by its power, forsaking their own humanity. Those who have fully succumbed to Hell's will cannot be saved, becoming mindless, grotesque contortions of their former selves."
